	Abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter covers the practices and processes for developing unmanned robotic spacecraft beginning and discusses the regulations and standards. These standards represent proven practices from government and industry. Government standards and regulations tend to hold sway in developing spacecraft. Commercial standards are less developed but generally tend to follow the government standards. Following the regulations and standards, the chapter covers examples of company processes and documentation that are typical of a successful spacecraft mission. In general these practices are implemented to meet the relevant requirements outlined in the regulations and standards, while enforcing consistency across projects for different customers. Examples of documentation of standard practices as well as project-level documentation are identified. Finally, the chapter wraps up with a case study of a successful NASA mission and the obstacles encountered during the project. The focus is on the aspects that contribute to reliable and successful missions.},

@inproceedings{Carpenter:2014aa,
	Abstract = {High safety and performance requirements drive the mission criticality of space exploration systems. There is often only one chance for mission success, and failure can be fatal. Although proximate causes of failure are often technical, root causes are usually mismanagement of the social context, leading to human error. Thus, while needing to maintain safety standards and faced with budgetary cuts and industry globalization, the space industry is driven to consider alternate methodologies by which to achieve success and limit failure. While Agile practices produce much interest within all aspects of mission-critical systems engineering, there is not much supporting data with respect to specific applicability of practices within the space industry. The need to review space-based systems engineering methodologies and to contemplate the applicability of disparate software engineering techniques, such as Agile, motivates the following research objective: The goal of this research is to identify which Agile practices, if any, are desirable and suitable for space-based systems engineering. Although some Agile practices may be discarded outright, others seem quite useful and should be given consideration. Scrum and extreme Programming (XP) show particular potential as does practicing hybrid approaches that combine Agile practices with existing formal methodologies and engineering standards.},

@article{Petersen20091479,
	Abstract = {Recent empirical studies have been conducted identifying a number of issues and advantages of incremental and agile methods. However, the majority of studies focused on one model (Extreme Programming) and small projects. To draw more general conclusions we conduct a case study in large-scale development identifying issues and advantages, and compare the results with previous empirical studies on the topic. The principle results are that (1) the case study and literature agree on the benefits while new issues arise when using agile in large-scale and (2) an empirical research framework is needed to make agile studies comparable. },

	Abstract = {AbstractContext Software industry has widely adopted Agile software development methods. Agile literature proposes a few key metrics but little is known of the actual metrics use in Agile teams. Objective The objective of this paper is to increase knowledge of the reasons for and effects of using metrics in industrial Agile development. We focus on the metrics that Agile teams use, rather than the ones used from outside by software engineering researchers. In addition, we analyse the influence of the used metrics. Method This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) on using metrics in industrial Agile software development. We identified 774 papers, which we reduced to 30 primary studies through our paper selection process. Results The results indicate that the reasons for and the effects of using metrics are focused on the following areas: sprint planning, progress tracking, software quality measurement, fixing software process problems, and motivating people. Additionally, we show that although Agile teams use many metrics suggested in the Agile literature, they also use many custom metrics. Finally, the most influential metrics in the primary studies are Velocity and Effort estimate. Conclusion The use of metrics in Agile software development is similar to Traditional software development. Projects and sprints need to be planned and tracked. Quality needs to be measured. Problems in the process need to be identified and fixed. Future work should focus on metrics that had high importance but low prevalence in our study, as they can offer the largest impact to the software industry.},

@article{Osmundson:2003aa,
	Abstract = {It can be argued that the quality of software management has an effect on the degree of success or failure of a software development program. We have developed a metric for measuring the quality of software management along four dimensions: requirements management, estimation/planning management, people management, and risk management. The quality management metric (QMM) for a software development program manager is a composite score obtained using a questionnaire administered to both the program manager and a sample of his or her peers. The QMM is intended to both characterize the quality of software management and serve as a template for improving software management performance. We administered the questionnaire to measure the performance of managers responsible for large software development programs within the US Department of Defense (DOD). Informal verification and validation of the metric compared the QMM score to an overall program-success score for the entire program; this resulted in a positive correlation.},

@article{Beck:1999aa,
	Abstract = {Traditional software engineering means have been characterized by a rather predictable process in the past. Users tell once and for all exactly what they want. Programmers design the system that will deliver those features. They code it; test it, and all is well. But all was not always well. The users did not tell once and for all exactly what they wanted. They changed their minds, and the users were not the only problem. Programmers could misjudge their progress. The academic software engineering community took the high cost of changing software as a challenge, creating technologies like relational databases, modular programming, and information hiding. This is where extreme programming comes in. Rather than planning, analyzing, and designing for the far-flung future, XP exploits the reduction in the cost of changing software to do all of these activities a little at a time, throughout software development. The paper discusses the major practices of XP},

	Abstract = {Gegeben wird ein {\"U}berblick {\"u}ber den aktuellen Stand der Normung auf dem Gebiet der Pr{\"u}fung und Qualit{\"a}tssicherung von Software mit Schwerpunkt Steuerungssoftware, der sowohl Normen als auch bereits ver{\"o}ffentlichte Normentw{\"u}rfe ber{\"u}cksichtigt. Derzeit existieren zahlreiche Normen und Normentw{\"u}rfe f{\"u}r Software unterschiedlicher Kategorien (Anwendungs-, System- und Steuerungssoftware). Sie unterscheiden sich einerseits nach dem Geltungsbereich, d.h. nach der Art von Software, auf die sie anwendbar sind. Andererseits werden mit Normen auch verschiedene Zwecke verfolgt, sie k{\"o}nnen z.B. zur Vereinheitlichung der verwendeten Begriffe dienen oder ganz konkrete Pr{\"u}fvorschriften festlegen. Ferner besch{\"a}ftigen sich gleichzeitig mehrere Normierungsgremien mit diesem Gebiet, was zum Teil zu sich inhaltlich {\"u}berschneidenden und noch nicht harmonisierten Entw{\"u}rfen f{\"u}hrt. Als Basis f{\"u}r die Entwicklung jeglicher Art von Software wird heute ein Qualit{\"a}tsmanagementsystem nach DIN EN ISO 9001 angesehen. Sie beschreibt organisatorische, administrative und technische Ma{\ss}nahmen eines Qualit{\"a}tsmanagementsystems. Bei der Entwicklung von Software mit Sicherheitsaufgaben m{\"u}ssen zus{\"a}tzliche Anforderungen erf{\"u}llt sein. In diesem Bereich sollten die Normentw{\"u}rfe IEC 1508 oder DIN V VDE 0801 herangezogen werden. Diese sind zwar noch nicht vollst{\"a}ndig ausgereift, stellen aber eine gute Informationsquelle dar. In Anwendungsbereichen mit besonders hohen Sicherheitsanforderungen (zivile Luftfahrt, Kerntechnik, Raumfahrt, Eisenbahntechnik) liegen anwendungsbezogene Standards vor. Soll nicht der Entwicklungsproze{\ss}, sondern das Endprodukt Software bewertet werden, mu{\ss} eine Produktpr{\"u}fung nach DIN ISO/IEC 12119 durchgef{\"u}hrt werden. Inhalt dieser Norm sind sowohl die Anforderungen an Software-Erzeugnisse (G{\"u}tebedingungen) als auch die Verfahren zu deren Pr{\"u}fung (Pr{\"u}fbestimmungen).},

	Abstract = {The identification, combination, and interaction of the many factors which influence software development productivity makes the measurement, estimation, comparison and tracking of productivity rates very difficult. Through the analysis of a European Space Agency database consisting of 99 software development projects from 37 companies in a European countries, the paper seeks to provide significant and useful Information about the major factors which influence the productivity of European space, military, and industrial applications, as well as to determine the best metric for measuring the productivity of these projects. Several key findings emerge from the study. The results indicate that some organizations are obtaining significantly higher productivity than others. Some of this variation is due to the differences in the application category and programming language of projects in each company; however, some differences must also be due to the ways in which these companies manage their software development projects. The use of tools and modern programming practices were found to be major controllable factors in productivity improvement. Finally, the lines-of-code productivity metric is shown to be superior to the process productivity metric for projects in the authors' database},

@article{Petersen:2010aa,
	Abstract = {So far, only few in-depth studies focused on the direct comparison of process models in general, and between plan-driven and incremental/agile approaches in particular. That is, it is not made explicit what the effect is of moving from one model to another model. Furthermore, there is limited evidence on advantages and issues encountered in agile software development, this is specifically true in the context of large-scale development. The objective of the paper is to investigate how the perception of bottlenecks, unnecessary work, and rework (from hereon referred to as issues) changes when migrating from a plan-driven to an incremental software development approach with agile practices (flexible product backlog, face-to-face interaction, and frequent integration), and how commonly perceived these practices are across different systems and development roles. The context in which the objective should be achieved is large-scale development with a market-driven focus. The selection of the context was based on the observation in related work that mostly small software development projects were investigated and that the investigation was focused on one agile model (eXtreme programming). A case study was conducted at a development site of Ericsson AB, located in Sweden in the end of 2007. In total 33 interviews were conducted in order to investigate the perceived change when migrating from plan-driven to incremental and agile software development, the interviews being the primary source of evidence. For triangulation purposes measurements collected by Ericsson were considered, the measurements relating to unnecessary work (amount of discarded requirements) and rework (data on testing efficiency and maintenance effort). Triangulation in this context means that the measurements were used to confirm the perceived changes with an additional data source. In total 64 issues were identified, 24 being of general nature and the remaining 40 being local and therefore unique to individual's opinions or a specific system. The most common ones were documented and analyzed in detail. The commonality refers to how many persons in different roles and across the systems studied have mentioned the issues for each of the process models. The majority of the most common issues relates to plan-driven development. We also identified common issues remaining for agile after the migration, which were related to testing lead-time, test coverage, software release, and coordination overhead. Improvements were identified as many issues commonly raised for the plan-driven approach were not raised anymore for the incremental and agile approach. It is concluded that the recent introduction (start in 2005 with the study being conducted in the end of 2007) of incremental and agile practices brings added values in comparison to the plan-driven approach, which is evident from the absence of critical issues that are encountered in plan-driven development.

@article{Baca:2015aa,
	Abstract = {A security-enhanced agile software development process, SEAP, is introduced in the development of a mobile money transfer system at Ericsson Corp. A specific characteristic of SEAP is that it includes a security group consisting of four different competences, i.e., Security manager, security architect, security master and penetration tester. Another significant feature of SEAP is an integrated risk analysis process. In analyzing risks in the development of the mobile money transfer system, a general finding was that SEAP either solves risks that were previously postponed or solves a larger proportion of the risks in a timely manner. The previous software development process, i.e., The baseline process of the comparison outlined in this paper, required 2.7 employee hours spent for every risk identified in the analysis process compared to, on the average, 1.5 hours for the SEAP. The baseline development process left 50{\%} of the risks unattended in the software version being developed, while SEAP reduced that figure to 22{\%}. Furthermore, SEAP increased the proportion of risks that were corrected from 12.5{\%} to 67.1{\%}, i.e., More than a five times increment. This is important, since an early correction may avoid severe attacks in the future. The security competence in SEAP accounts for 5{\%} of the personnel cost in the mobile money transfer system project. As a comparison, the corresponding figure, i.e., For security, was 1{\%} in the previous development process.},

	Abstract = {Agile software development represents a major departure from traditional, plan-based approaches to software engineering. A systematic review of empirical studies of agile software development up to and including 2005 was conducted. The search strategy identified 1996 studies, of which 36 were identified as empirical studies. The studies were grouped into four themes: introduction and adoption, human and social factors, perceptions on agile methods, and comparative studies. The review investigates what is currently known about the benefits and limitations of, and the strength of evidence for, agile methods. Implications for research and practice are presented. The main implication for research is a need for more and better empirical studies of agile software development within a common research agenda. For the industrial readership, the review provides a map of findings, according to topic, that can be compared for relevance to their own settings and situations.},
